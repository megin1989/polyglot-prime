# CCDA TechBD Schema Files

This directory contains Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (CCDA) schema files used for validating and processing CCDA documents within the Tech by Design integration platform.

## üìÑ Overview

CCDA schemas define the structure and constraints for clinical documents exchanged between healthcare systems. These files are essential for:
- Validating incoming and outgoing CCDA XML documents
- Ensuring interoperability and compliance with healthcare standards
- Supporting automated testing and integration workflows

## üìÅ Folder Structure

All schema files in this folder are referenced by integration channels and validation tools. Please do not modify these files unless you are updating to a new CCDA specification or patching a known issue.
